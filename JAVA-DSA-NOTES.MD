## **Java DSA Introduction**

` What is a Data Structure ? `
- DSA Data Structures are the different ways of organizing data on your computer that can be used effectively

` What is an Algorithim ?`
- Set of Instructions t perform a Task

` What makes a good Algorithim `
- Correctness
- Efficiency

` Why most Companies ask DSA ? `
- Problem Solving Skills
- Fundamental Concepts of Programming in Limited Time

` Type Of Data Structures `
- Two Types of DS (Primitive and Non-Primitive)
- Primitive
  - Integer
  - Float
  - Boolean
  - Character
- Non-Primitive
  - Linear (Sequentially)
    - Static
      - Array
    - Dynamic
      - Linked List
      - Stack
      - Queue
  - Non Linear (Non Sequentially)
    - Tree
    - Graph

` Types of Algorithims `
- Simple Recursive Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- Greedy Algorithms
- Brute Force Algorithms
- Randomized Algorithms

` What Is Big O Notation `
- Big O Is a Language or Metric we use to measure the efficiency of the algorithm

` What is Time Complexity `
- A Way of showing how much the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases.

` What is Space Complexity `
- A way of showing that how much it will consume when you run the functions as the input/output increases
